## Prerequisites

- Node.js v16+
- npm or yarn
- Access to an Ethereum API endpoint (e.g., Quicknode, Infura, Alchemy)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ethWebSocketServer.git
   cd ethWebSocketServer
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your configuration:
   ```
   # Ethereum Node Connection
   ETHEREUM_NODE_URL=your_ethereum_endpoint_url
   
   # WebSocket Server Configuration
   WS_PORT=3000

## Usage

### Development

Start the server in development mode with hot reloading:

```
npm run dev
```

### Production

Build and start the server in production mode:

```
npm run build
npm start
```

### Running the Example Client

An example client implementation is included to test connectivity:

```
npm run client
```

### Block Metrics Example

To explore the block metrics functionality:

```
cd examples
npx ts-node blockMetrics.ts
```

## WebSocket API

Clients can connect to the WebSocket server at `ws://localhost:3000` (or whatever port you configure).

## Block Metrics

Each block now includes a `metrics` object with the following properties:

| Metric | Description | Units |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| `averageTxValue` | Average value of all transactions in the block | Wei (string) |
| `highestTxValue` | Highest transaction value in the block | Wei (string) |
| `lowestTxValue` | Lowest non-zero transaction value in the block | Wei (string) |
| `transactionCounts` | Number of each transaction type | Object |
| `transactionCounts.legacy` | Number of legacy transactions | Number |
| `transactionCounts.eip1559` | Number of EIP-1559 transactions | Number |
| `transactionCounts.blob` | Number of blob transactions (EIP-4844) | Number |
| `gasSums` | Sum of gas limits by transaction type | Object |
| `gasSums.legacy` | Total gas for legacy transactions | String |
| `gasSums.eip1559` | Total gas for EIP-1559 transactions | String |
| `gasSums.blob` | Total gas for blob transactions | String |
| `gasSums.total` | Total gas for all transactions | String |
| `highestGasPrice` | Highest gas price of any transaction | Wei (string) |
| `lowestGasPrice` | Lowest gas price of any transaction | Wei (string) |
| `averageGasPrice` | Average gas price across all transactions | Wei (string) |

## Architecture

The system is built with a modular architecture:

- **EthereumService**: Handles blockchain connection and event subscription
- **BlockManager**: Maintains the in-memory block cache and emits events
- **WebSocketServer**: Manages client connections and message handling
- **BlockMetrics**: Calculates transaction metrics for each block
- **Application**: Coordinates all components and handles lifecycle

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

- Ensure your Ethereum node URL in the `.env` file is valid and accessible
- Check that you're using the correct port specified in your `.env` file
- Make sure your firewall allows WebSocket connections on the configured port

### Large Block Handling

For handling large blocks with many transactions:

1. Increase the `WS_PORT` number in your `.env` if necessary
2. Consider reducing the number of blocks cached with `NUM_BLOCKS_TO_CACHE` 
3. Use selective filtering in your subscription to include only needed fields

### Client-Side Considerations

When implementing a client:

- Configure appropriate WebSocket buffer sizes for large blocks
- Implement reconnection logic for handling disconnections
- Use selective field filtering to reduce payload size

## Testing with Postman

You can use Postman to test the WebSocket server:

1. Open Postman and create a new WebSocket request
2. Set the URL to `ws://localhost:3000` (or your configured port)
3. Connect to the WebSocket server by clicking "Connect"

### Sending Messages

1. Once connected, you can send subscription messages in the "Message" panel:
   ```json
   {
     "type": "SUBSCRIBE",
     "data": {
       "topic": "all_blocks",
       "options": {
         "includeTransactions": true,
         "filterFields": ["hash", "number", "timestamp", "miner", "metrics"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

2. To unsubscribe:
   ```json
   {
     "type": "UNSUBSCRIBE",
     "data": {
       "topic": "all_blocks"
     }
   }
   ```

### Configuring Maximum Payload Size

Ethereum blocks can be large, especially when including transactions. To handle this in Postman:

1. Go to Settings (Settings Tab - underneath the Request address URL)
2. Configure 'Maximum Message Size' to 0.
